  <h1 class="casefile-title">Closing Statements</h1>

  <p class="casefile-lede">
    Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you have now reviewed every piece of evidence entered into this record. 
    The testimony did not come from eyewitnesses or informants, but from the data itself. 
    Tumor features, survival curves, model estimates, and risk patterns have all revealed the same truth.
  </p>

  <p class="casefile-lede">
    Breast Cancer strikes across ages, but most often between 47 and 61. 
    It infiltrates quietly, grows without restraint, spreads through lymph nodes, 
    and hides behind delayed detection. 
    You saw how survival drops with advancing stage and nodal involvement, 
    and how hormone receptor status shapes the defendant’s behavior.
  </p>

  <p class="casefile-lede">
    The evidence also made clear that the burden is not equal. 
    Survival curves showed racial disparities, reminding us that Breast Cancer exploits 
    gaps in access, resources, and structural equity. 
    The Cox model quantified these patterns, and validation through bootstrapping 
    and cross-validation confirmed they were not chance, but the defendant’s signature.
  </p>

  <p class="casefile-lede">
    This case has always been about one question: 
    is the evidence strong enough to convict? 
    The models, the graphics, the survival patterns all point in the same direction. 
    **The harm is real. The pattern is consistent. The responsibility is clear.**
  </p>

  <p class="casefile-lede">
    The People of P8105 submit that there is only one reasonable verdict. 
    Based on the scientific forensic record you have examined, **the defendant is guilty**.
  </p>

  <p class="casefile-lede">
    The prosecution rests.
  </p>
